            Recommendation Systems are applications that have become very
            fundamental with the massive growth of the Internet, as they started
            to help the customers of different services to choose products that
            fit the most into their interest in an automated way. Additionally,
            with the increase in data volume, it is essential to use
            computational approaches for the automatic recommendation task. The
            implementation of these systems has been, therefore, crucial to the
            efficient operation of a lot of different businesses, being within
            the main ones, the streaming services. With the increasing
            popularity of these services, which have so many options, whether
            they are products for purchase or content for immediate consumption
            (such as media as TV Series), the need arose to increasingly improve
            the techniques used in the recommendation systems applied within
            these services, as the large number of options sometimes are not
            attractive to the costumer, being more efficient to show items that
            are into the area of interest of this customer. We used some data
            manipulation techniques in a movie dataset, to be able to create
            machine learning models that are capable of generating
            recommendations, graphically checking their effectiveness and
            performance in generating such recommendations.
